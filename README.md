# ECE-DEVOPS

# The Project

This is the repository of the first devops lab. This lab is about creating a simple git repository in which we will create a basic web server that would return "Hello World!" when trying to connect to it.

## Functionnalities

When the index.js is called or when the user writes **npm start** in his terminal, it will start the web server on his computer. The web server is in localhost and listening to the port 3000.

## Installation

To install this project you can:
- Clone the repository on you computer
- Download the zip file and extract it wherever your want on you computer

## Usage Instructions

When the main folder is installed, you can open it in a terminal and use one of the following commands to launch it.
'''js
npm start
# or
npm run start
'''
A local web server listening to the port 3000 will then be up. It will return 'Hello World!' when someone tries to connect to it.
